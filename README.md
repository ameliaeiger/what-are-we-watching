## About the project:
What Are We Watching is mobile application designed to help people make a decision on what to watch together. 
We have all been in a situation where you sit down to watch something with a friend, partner or family member, 
only to spend 30 mins trying to agree on what to watch.

What Are We Watching helps to solve that issue by matching users choices via the app. A user creates an event, (or joins
an existing event), and votes on what to watch. As soon as there is a match, the decision is made!
